    \item{\code{v3rbq002}}{Volunteers a large amount of information about self}
    \item{\code{v3rbq003}}{Seems interested in what someone had to say (Disregard whether interest appears "genuine" or "polite")}
    \item{\code{v3rbq004}}{Tries to control the situation (Disregard whether attempts at control succeed or not)}
    \item{\code{v3rbq005}}{Dominates the situation (Disregard intention, e.g., if P dominates the situation "by default" because other(s) present do very little, this item should receive high placement)}
    \item{\code{v3rbq006}}{Appears to be relaxed and comfortable}
    \item{\code{v3rbq007}}{Exhibits social skills (e.g., does things to make other(s) comfortable, keeps conversation moving, entertains or charms other(s))}
